Hi! I am a Montreal-born Speech & Language pathologist and researcher in Developmental Psychology. I recently obtained my Ph.D. from the University of California San Diego, where I worked in collaboration with Dr. David Barner in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/ladlab/home?pli=1" target="_top">Language and Development Lab</a>. My research was supported by an SSHRC doctoral grant. </p>

Broadly, I am interested in how young children learn basic mathematical concepts/skills - e.g., numbers, counting, and estimation â€“ and specifically, I study how natural language contributes to the development of these mathematical representations. I approach this puzzle by studying bilingual children (e.g., French-English, Spanish-English speakers). 


By documenting similarities and differences in performances across bilinguals' languages, I can learn about the role of language-specific experiences in the development of numerical representations. My work contributes to a growing literature showing that some knowledge and skills are resistant to transfer across languages while others are more permeable across languages. Moving forward, I want to expand this line of work and our understanding of the intersection between mathematical thoughts and natural language.

Beyond using bilingualism as a tool to study numerical representations, I am also interested in bilingualism in and of itself, stemming both from personal experience and because bilingualism is increasingly experienced by young learners throughout the world. One of my goals in studying bilingualism is to help improve teaching practices in early education.

As a Speech and Language Pathologist, I am also interested in early literacy and questions such as: what makes books interesting for children, and how we can facilitate/bootstrap learning through literacy. Recently, as a personal project, I started to review picture books for children on the topic of numeracy/STEM and blog about how the content of the books is reflected in research and vice-versa. For more info, see the blog posts below.

Finally, when I am not working on research or teaching, I like to bake goods using all types of different squashes. I am also an avid backpacker, a maple syrup enthusiast :canada: and Beaver Believer :beaver:.
