<p align="justify"><strong>Overview</strong>: Did you know that the human brain contains <em>about</em> <u>86 billion</u> neurons! In this book, the author teaches us similar amazing facts about numbers but related to animals’ lives. For example, caribous shed (~) 10 sets of antlers in their lifetime. At the end of the book, the author explains the reasoning process involved in making these estimates.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Activity Ideas</strong>: 1) Ask children to estimate the number of items (e.g., antlers, seahorses, etc) illustrated on the pages before telling them the real number. 2) With school-aged children, you can use the facts provided by the author at the end of the book to make children estimate the number of items illustrated in the book (or other things in the world). This is different from the activity above because here, you are not asking children to estimate based on the picture they see, but rather, you are asking children to estimate using reference points and calibration/proportional reasoning.</p>
