Hi! I am a Montreal-born Speech & Language pathologist and Assistant Professor at Fisher College (Boston). I obtained my Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of California San Diego, where I worked in collaboration with Dr. David Barner in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/ladlab/home?pli=1" target="_top">Language and Development Lab</a>. My research was supported by an SSHRC doctoral grant. </p>

Broadly, during my Ph.D., I investigated how young children learn basic mathematical concepts/skills - e.g., numbers, counting, and estimation – and specifically, I studied how natural language contributes to the development of these mathematical representations. I approached this puzzle by studying bilingual children (e.g., French-English, Spanish-English speakers) in Canada and the United States. Ultimately, my work added to a growing literature showing that some numerical knowledge and skills are permeable across languages while others are more resistant to transfer – and consequently require language-specific training in both languages (see publications page). My hope with this line of work is to help improve teaching practices in early education, in particular for multilingual learners.

At Fisher College, I teach Introduction to Psychology, the Psychology of Learning, and Human Development.

Finally, when I am not working on research or teaching, I like to bake goods using all types of different squashes. I am also an avid backpacker, a maple syrup enthusiast :canada: and Beaver Believer.
